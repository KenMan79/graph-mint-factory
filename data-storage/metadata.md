# Metadata

## Is my metadata stored on chain?

No, blockchain is about trade-offs right now and finding compromises. For us, the usability is a main focus.  The decentralized web is incrementally getting  better day by day.  Blockchains at its current state are mainly not built to store data on it, thatâ€™s why there are projects like IPFS, FileCoin, Swarm and Pinata being built.  None of these projects can compete with traditional storage options. Decentralizing every single piece of our business is not possible just yet because it would mean major drawbacks and inferior, slower processes or even complete loss of data.
