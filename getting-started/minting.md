### Select "Mint" to publish the item in your shop

Note that you can not change the price after having published your item. You can upload an image, soon we will also allow you to add videos and other properties. You can determine how many products or items you want to create by dragging the bar under "Mint this many". If you are minting a product for sale, please select the "Is for Sale" button and choose a price. Please note that the conversion is fluctuating real-time with the ETH price. If you want to create a free item, unselect the box "Is for Sale".
