**7. Confirm the** [**gas fee**](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/ethereum-gas/)**. It is a price the Ethereum blockchain takes for the transaction.** 

**Do not "Speed up" the transaction!** Once you speed it up, we lose the connection from the code. If you do this, please contact support and we can find it manually. We are very reachable on Telegram [https://t.me/mintbase](https://t.me/mintbase)

Please note that you can find more information on the gas fee in our [FAQs](ethereum-gas-fee.md).

**The amount will be deducted from your wallet.**
